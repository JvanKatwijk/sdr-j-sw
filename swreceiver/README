Version 6.0 of the sdr-j sw receiver

There are architectural changes in the software to allow a better
handling of the various sticks (fast devices).
The backend program is gone (for now), as is the 32 bits fm receiver.
The latter is integrated with the 64 bits fm receiver to obtain a single
fm receiver for fast and slow devices.

For fast devices, one may select an inputrate of 96, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768 Ksamples/second.

For generating an executable: see the instructions in the manual,



Version 5.0 of the sdr-j sw receiver.
There is a radical change in the structure of the software compared to
versions 3 and 4.
In version 5, the decoders and the hardware drivers are implemented
as plugins. The location of the plugin directory is now given
in the ".ini" files for the swradio, swbackend and fmradio.
To ease setting up, a small program, configure-sw, is available
with which the paths for the decoders resp. drivers can be set
in the ini files.

The set is extended with a backend program, a program providing the
various decoders for use with either recordings of the output of
a "classic" receiver.

Furthermore, the smallband version of the fmreceiver is included,
allowing e.g. the pmSDR to be used as fm broadcast receiver.

Please read the manual for generating the executables
If you build, do support-lib first and ensure that the ".so" file
is somewhere in the loadpath. After that, take any order you want.

The decoders directory and the input directory have a "create-..." script
that - when all prerequisites are met - will generate the plugins

Default location for the input plugins is "linux-bin/input",
default location for the decoder plugins is "linux-bin/decoders"

All three programs will look for ./input-plugins and ./decoder-plugins.
If you want to run the program swradio, swbackend and fmradio in some
other environment, please run configure-sw first to record the paths
in the various ini files.
