There has been quite some developments on the code for supporting dabsticks.
This software assumes that there is a library "rtlsdr.." available.
The easiest is to take the library from the osmocom site, however,
there are other versions as well.
You might want to try the version from Leif Albrink

A good alternative (for me) was the one from
http://www.rtl-sdr.com/new-experimental-r820t-rtl-sdr-driver-tunes-13-mhz-lower/

With the latter one I was able to listen to the Radio Romenia DRM transmissions on 7350 and the Khampur DRM transmission on 7550.
