A recent change in the sdrplay installer leads to an incompatible 
naming of some library.

If you havw the most recent installer used (afaik 14 nov 2015)
please define
#define	SDRLAY_LIBRARY_NEW
in either the configuration file of the sdrplay device or
in the file .../swreceiver/plugins/input/mirics-sdrplay/sdrplay-loader.cpp
