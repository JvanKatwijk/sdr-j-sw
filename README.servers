Since I like to listen and develop programs from my lazy chair, I made two
small and simple servers for the SDRplay resp. DABsticks.
They are connected to an RPI 2, control the devices and filter and decimate
the data before sending a stream of samples to a TCP port.

The sw software contains a client for each of these.
